Access control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The iommi admin only allows access to users with the `is_staff` flag. Other than that iommi doesn't enforce any access control on its own. If you need any you have to implement it yourself for your specific use case. That being said here are a few ideas:

- Middleware that checks URL of requests coming in, limiting certain paths (or all paths) to logged in users, users belonging to certain groups, etc. This is the easiest to get right as it's in one place and is easy to reason about. It can't handle many common cases, but it can be a good base to stand on.
- Path decoders in iommi can be used for access control if the object being decoded has access semantics. For example `/company/1/` could validate that the user is a member of the company with pk 1.
- You can generalize path decoder logic to call an `has_access` method on the model you decode.
- The `LoginRequiredMiddleware <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/middleware/#django.contrib.auth.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware>`_ can be used to default URLs to denied, where you have to mark allowed URLs with the `@login_not_required` decorator.
