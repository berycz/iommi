Common config
-------------

Many configuration options are common across iommi, forming part of the cohesive structure which makes it easy to transfer your skills from one part of iommi to another. The most important is `include` which is the command you use to include or exclude a part from an iommi component, for example removing a field from a form or including a field that by default would be hidden (like the primary key for forms and tables).

`attr` and `attrs` are important to understand the difference between.

`auto` is used to generate forms, tables, etc from models.
