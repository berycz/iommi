    Philosophy
    ==========

    iommi follows a design philosophy that has evolved over several
    years. It might feel a bit strange in the beginning but we believe
    it's well worth it.

    We want it to always be possible to create higher abstractions where
    you can reuse those abstractions with small tweaks *without having to
    change the abstraction to enable this*. If you have code that creates
    a complex page with tables, forms, and help text fragments in several places,
    then you should be able to reuse that but with a single line of code
    make a change to a single small detail of that page, like adding a CSS
    class somewhere.

    In standard APIs you often have to copy paste the entire page and make
    a small change. This hides the difference between the two pages because you
    spend 99% of the code to say the same thing. Or alternatively you have to
    pollute the definition of the first page with some super specific option
    that makes that code worse. We want to avoid both these scenarios.

    In short we want to be able to have code that reads like:

        It's like that one, but different like this.

    The philosophy has these main parts:

def test_no_silent_mistakes():

    """
    No silent mistakes
    ---------------------

    Systems that fail silently are the worst. Like when you try to render a
    value in a django template and you just get silence instead of an error telling
    you that you misspelled the variable name. Or when you define a `clean_albumm` method
    that never gets called because you misspelled "album" (or worse if you renamed
    album to record!). Or silent changes to behavior because you upgraded a library
    and your overridden method isn't called because they renamed the function in
    the class you inherited from.

    In iommi we have an explicit design goal that all mistakes made by the
    programmer should (if at all possible) be an error with a very good
    error message telling them how to fix the problem.

    To accomplish this we:

    - don't override using standard object oriented overriding, instead preferring `refining <https://kodare.net/2018/06/25/refinableobject-object-orientation-refined.html>`_
    - show you the valid values when you supply an invalid one, one per line and in alphabetical order
    - detect common mistakes we've made and have helpful error messages telling you what to do or why you can't do that thing

    We love Django, but it does silently fail in many places. In iommi we try our hardest to never let you get stuck with silence as your only company.

    Everything has a name
    ---------------------

    We like to think of GUIs as a tree of items like tables, buttons, links
    and pages. We want it to be easy to reference an item in this tree so we
    can change some property of it, ask it about its configuration, or its state,
    and more. This is why iommi requires names for everything. This might seem
    overly verbose in the beginning but this is what enables many of the powerful
    features of iommi and the robust error handling and error messages.

    This philosophy is what enables `Single point customization with no boilerplate`_ via :ref:`dispatching`.

    Traversing a namespace is done with `__` when `.` can't be used in normal python syntax
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you have a class `Car` that has a member `engine` of type `Engine`. Now
    let's say you want to create a `Car` with an electric engine. In standard
    OOP the `Car` constructor might take an `engine` parameter so you'll end up
    with something like:

    """
    # @test
    class ElectricEngine:
        pass

    # @end

    car = Car(engine=ElectricEngine())

    # language=rst
    """
    which is fine if you want to replace the entire engine, but if you just wanted
    to configure a small thing but keep all the defaults this can become noisy:


    """
    car = Car(
        engine=InternalCombustionEngine(
            turbo=True,
            cylinders=6,

                clutch_type='double',

        )
    )

    Now it's impossible to see the intent of the programmer: which of all those
    options was the single thing they wanted to change and which are copy paste
    of the defaults? Turns out in this case it was just the `clutch_type`! We
    would like to write:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        car = Car(engine.gearbox.clutch_type='double')

    but pythons syntax doesn't allow this. So instead we use `__`:

    Callables for advanced usage, values for the simple cases

    We want the simple cases to be obvious and simple and the complex cases to
    be possible. To enable this we aim to make it so that every place you can
    place a value, you can use a lambda. So for example the simple case could be:


    """
    form = Form(
        auto__model=Musician,
        fields__instrument__initial='guitar',
    )

        auto__model=Musician,
        fields__instrument__initial=
            lambda request, **_: 'guitar' if request.user.is_staff else 'tambourine',
    )

    # @test
    form.bind(request=req('get'))
    # @end

    # language=rst
    """
    In this case you have e.g. `form`, and `field` accessible. If you don't
    know which arguments you can use, you can write whatever and you will get an
    error message telling you what arguments are available.

    Late binding
    ------------

    Late binding allows us to sometimes avoid doing work, but more importantly
    it enables us to build more flexible customizations. A concrete example can
    be to show a column in a table for only staff users even though the table is
    defined in the module scope, long before there even is a request object.

    Late binding is accomplished by two mechanisms:

    - not creating object structures until the :ref:`bind` phase
    - and `Callables for advanced usage, values for the simple cases`_

    The ``@declarative`` and ``@with_meta``

    that can look both like a normal simple python API:

    This code is hopefully pretty self explanatory. But the cool thing is
    that we can do the exact same thing with a declarative style:

        foo = Column()
        bar = Column()

    This style can be much more readable. There's a subtle different though
    between the first and second styles: the second is really a way to
    declare defaults, not hard coding values. This means we can create
    instances of the class and set the values in the call to the
    constructor:

    my_table = MyTable(
        columns__foo__include=False,  # <- hides the column foo

    my_table.bind(request=req('get'))
    # @end

    # language=rst

    ...without having to create a new class inheriting from ``MyTable``. So
    the API keeps all the power of the simple style and also getting the
    nice syntax of a declarative API.

    Prepackaged commonly used patterns (that can still be customized!)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    A pattern you'll see often in iommi is that we have class methods instead of
    classes. We call these "shortcuts". We don't need to have classes in order to
    share functionality and in fact we think this hinders composability and hides
    lack of customizability.

    A shortcut is a bunch of config (and sometimes a tiny bit of code) that also
    has a name. We use these instead of writing e.g. `Field` subclasses. The names of
    these shortcuts are also used by the style system to determine what rules to
    apply.

    An important difference between a traditional class and a shortcut is that the
    config in a shortcut are defaults, not hard behavior. That means we can start
    with a shortcut that does mostly what we want and then pass one or more
    arguments to further refine. Again without writing a class.

    """
    Single point customization with no boilerplate
    ----------------------------------------------

    GUIs consists of layers of abstraction like a form containing fields,
    fields containing input tags, and a button. But in traditional APIs, to customize the input tag of
    a form field row you must subclass several classes even for very trivial
    things. Often trivial things also requires copy pasting a template and making
    a minor change. This leads to lots of code that basically does nothing and it
    *hides* the unique and relevant code in the noise of the other cruft around
    it that is just copy paste or boilerplate.

    In iommi we strive to avoid this by enabling one-off customizations with
    *no boilerplate*. To set a CSS style on a specific input field inside a form
    that was automatically generated we can write:


    """
    Form(
        auto__model=Album,
        fields__year__input__attrs__style__font='helvetica')

    hatches for when you reach the limits of iommi. You should be able to add your
    own logic and data without having to subclass or patch the code.
